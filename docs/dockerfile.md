# Dockerfile

* The **Dockerfile** has the following features:

  * **Portability:** Named volumes are managed by Docker, making your setup more portable across different environments without relying on the host's directory structure.
  * **Performance:** Docker named volumes often provide better performance, especially on non-Linux systems.
  * **Data Management:** Easier to manage and backup data using Docker commands.

2) Structured Environment Variables: This provides the following benefits:
  * Readability: Using key-value pairs enhances readability and makes it easier to add more environment variables in the future.
  * Flexibility: Simplifies the integration with tools that parse YAML configurations.

3) Resource Constraints:
   * Ensures the container doesn't exceed allocated resources, promoting stability.
